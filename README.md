## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Memory Bank structure not found"
**Solution**:
1. Ensure `memory-bank/` directory exists in project root
2. Create `memory-bank/tasks.md` with project requirements
3. Add `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` with project context
4. Restart the design mode

#### Issue: "Platform detection failed"
**Solution**:
1. Check if `package.json` exists (for web/React Native projects)
2. Verify `pubspec.yaml` exists (for Flutter projects)
3. Ensure platform-specific folders exist (`ios/`, `android/`)
4. Manually specify platform if auto-detection fails

#### Issue: "Design system audit incomplete"
**Solution**:
1. Create basic style guide in `memory-bank/style-guide.md`
2. Document existing design tokens and components
3. Add brand guidelines and design principles
4. Re-run the design system audit

#### Issue: "Accessibility validation errors"
**Solution**:
1. Review WCAG AAA requirements in the accessibility guide
2. Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, TalkBack)
3. Verify color contrast ratios (7:1 for AAA)
4. Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
5. Test with users who have disabilities

#### Issue: "Performance targets not met"
**Solution**:
1. Optimize image assets and use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
2. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
3. Use code splitting for large component libraries
4. Minimize animation complexity
5. Test on lower-end devices

#### Issue: "Responsive design validation failed"
**Solution**:
1. Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools
2. Verify touch targets meet minimum size requirements
3. Check orientation change handling
4. Validate safe area handling on notched devices
5. Test with different text sizes and zoom levels
